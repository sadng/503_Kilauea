        <h2>Sadie's personal Kilauea experiences</h2>
            
        <p1>30-miles away from the University of Hawai'i at Hilo, is one of the worlds most active volcanoes.
            With organizations such as the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Hawaiian Volcanoes Observatory (HVO), the Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes (CSAV), Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HVNP) and more, education and interaction with the active volcano is continuously prioritized.
            Through various research opportunities in tandem with the organizations, extracurriculars, and courses at UH Hilo, students are allowed various opportunities to immerse their education to Kilauea.
        <p class="brbig"></p>
            Sadie attended the University of Hawai'i Hilo from August 2020 to May 2022, recieving her Bachelor of Science degree in Geology.
            While here, she took a volcanology course and contributed to the University of Hawaii Hilo, Crack team!
            Hiking throughout Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, the team took on geodetic line-leveling research to discover vertical deformation, in tandem with the United States Geological Survey - Hawaiian Volcanoes Observatory.
            This ongoing research process was presented at the Geological Society of America (GSA) 2022 Cordilleran and Rocky Mountain Joint Section Meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada.
        <p class="brbig"></p>
            Although Sadie was only able to feel two earthquakes and experience two of Kilauea's eruptions, visiting the volcano was something she did for lecture and leisure.
