        <h1>Pu‘u‘ō‘ō Eruption</h1>
        <h2>1983 to 2018</h2>

        <p1>Lasting 35 years, the Pu‘u‘ō‘ō Eruption began on January 3rd, 1983 and ended on April 30th, 2018 due to the crater floor and lava lake collapsing.
            From this eruption, 55.6 square miles were covered in lava flow, and 439 acres of new land was created along Kilauea's southeastern shore.
            USGS scientists divided the eruption into 61 eruptive episodes, breaking them down into five broad time periods defining the eruption.
        <p class="brbig"></p>
            January 1983 to July 1986: Growth of Pu‘u‘ō‘ō
            <br>
            July 1986 to February 1992: Activity shifts downrift, builds a shield, and buries Kalapana
            <br>
            February 1992 to June 2007: Activity returns to Pu‘u‘ō‘ō and fissure erupts uprift
            <br>
            July 2007 to March 2011: Fissure erupts downrift, Pu‘u‘ō‘ō fills, and fissure erupts uprift
            <br>
            April 2011 to April 2018: Vents confined to Pu‘u‘ō‘ō crater and flanks, flows enter Pāhoa
        </p1>
        <p4>
            Below on the map, you are able to compare two different flows that occured back to back during the last broad time period.
            The orange flow occured from June 2014 to June 2016, and the blue flow followed from May 2016 to May 2017.
            Please feel free to turn each layer on and off in the legend for further analysis.
