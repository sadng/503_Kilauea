        <p1>On April 30th, 2018, the Kilauea crater collapsed, ending the long lived Pu‘u‘ō‘ō eruption.
            Days later on May 3rd, 2018, lava broke the surface along the lower East Rift Zone.
            This was the start of Kilauea's 2018 eruption.
            On September 5th, 2018, this eruption had its last active flow of lava visible throughout fissure 8.
        <p class="brbig"></p>
            Fissure vents throughout the lower East rift zone erupted viscous lava flows throughout Leilani Estates, a residential subdivision.
            Mid-May, lava flows began traveling faster and further, as the magma started becoming hotter and more fluid.
            In late May, the Kilauea caldera continued to collapse as the eruption slowly drained its magma chamber.
            Throughout this eruption, a total of 62 collapse events occurred.
            Over 8,700 acres was covered by lava, with 875 of those acres being new land created due to the eruption.
            Over 700 structures and 30 miles of road were covered and/or inaccessible due to blocked access.
        <p class="brbig"></p>
            In the map featured above, you are able to see the lava flow footprint and each fissure line created from the 2018 lower East Rift Zone eruption.
            Go ahead and zoom into the South East flank of the island, and click to learn more about each indvidual fissure line.
            You are also able to look at the tephra deposits throughout the Big Island, with the ability to learn about their age, composition, and more.
            It was determinded in previous research Sadie Nguyen was apart of, that there was no new tephra deposits created by the 2018 eruption.
            But, with this data you can see the tephra deposits that stood its way through the lava flow.
